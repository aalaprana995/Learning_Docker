# Learning_Docker
This is a repository that has some starting points to help with docker.
## Basic Concept
- Docker is a way to package applications with all the required dependencies and configurations to run the application.
- Docker containers are portable, thus can be shared easily between developers and operational team making the development process fast.
- Containers live in container repositories and docker repositories can be public or private.
## Development Process Before-vs-After

### Before
- For developing an application, each developer has a local system on which he installs the required dependencies and configuration to run and develop features.
- Thus, each developer has a different installation process as they use different OS.
- This creates a room for lot of errors as each OS needs different commands and steps to be followed. It also  makes the process tedious for the developer.
- Developer and operational teams need to have good communication, or else any misundersatnding can lead to -----------. 
### After
- With container we donot have to directly install any application on local OS, because container is itself its own seperate environment.
- Fetching and running docker container is easy and we have to run the same command independent of the OS.
- We can have different version of the same application running without any problem on our system.
- No environmnet configuration needed on server.
- It improves and makes devops process faster and easy as developers and operational team works together.
